# P-AS-final-project
This is a project that I submitted at the end of my Fall 2022 semester for my Probability and Applied Statistics class.

It demonstrates the usage of:
- GNU Octave
- Java
- Probability and Statistics
- Github

Each of these mini-projects required research to accomplish.
The mini-projects related to Octave were completed after going through tutorials, making my own tutorial, and then applying what I learned.

Here is a breakdown of each project:
>**JAVA - Plot Salt Smooth**
  This application demonstrates the usage of JFreeChart by taking a dataset and applying "plot, salt, and smooth" to it.
>
>**JAVA - Poker Project**
  This application shows the probability rates for winning with different poker hands. Then, it simulated a poker game by comparing player hands.
>
>**JAVA - StatsLibrary**
  This application compiles multiple statistic/probability operations and formulas used throughout the semester. It is meant to be a toolkit.
>
>**OCTAVE - Plot Salt Smooth**
  This application demonstrates the knowledge I learned in Octave by applying the same "plot, salt, and smooth" methods to a dataset using GNU Octave.

The **Project 2 Wrap-Up Report.docx** is a final written report describing each project as well as a few more tasks that were assigned. It gives a much more in-depth summary of what was assigned and the results.

The **P&AS Formula Sheet.docx** is a written document of all of the formulas that I learned throughout the semester in Probability and Applied Statistics.
